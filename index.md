## What we’re building

- <strong>Threads of Memory</strong> — an immersive arts experiment weaving local textile heritage with sound + spatial media.
- <strong>Culture x Tech</strong> — playful prototypes that make new tools feel human, inclusive, and locally useful.
- <strong>Lab Notes</strong> — open work‑in‑progress so others can follow, learn, and remix.

## Why it matters

- Artist‑led prototyping with community voices.
- Accessibility from the start (lo‑fi to hi‑fi; screen‑reader‑friendly docs; alt text on media).
- Open knowledge: we publish methods, learnings, and templates.
- Joy + humanity: we believe technology should feel playful, caring, and made for people — not just systems.

<!-- ## Status (live)

- Site scaffolded; theme toggle active (Fern ↔︎ Lab, Light ↔︎ Dark).
- First prototype: VR/textile scene shell ready.
- Lab Notes rolling updates. -->

We closed the first sprint of Rituals & Flows. The experiment showed how small modular pieces can flex to individual needs.

### What changed

- Documented design decisions and open questions
- Archived code + assets into repo
- Shared takeaways with Rainforest Studio team

### Next steps

- Consider extending into a **community-facing kit**
- Explore integration with other prototypes (e.g., cultural prompts)

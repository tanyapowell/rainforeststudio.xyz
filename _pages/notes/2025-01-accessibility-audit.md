Ally (our AI accessibility checker) ran an initial sweep. The prototype scored **ok**, but we found key areas to improve.

### What changed

- Adjusted color tokens for higher contrast
- Added visible focus states to buttons
- Rewrote prompt explanations in plain language

### Next steps

- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Add reduced-motion mode for animations

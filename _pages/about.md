# About Rainforest Studio

Rainforest Studio is a **Lab without Walls** — a place where culture and technology meet to prototype new ideas, test them with real people, and share what we learn openly.

Founded by Tanya, the studio is rooted in **London** and connected to a wider creative tech community. We’re building pathways towards **Haringey Borough of Culture 2027**, ensuring local stories and creative voices are part of the future.

## What we do

- **Prototyping culture + AI** — playful experiments that combine heritage, storytelling, and emerging tools.
- **Co‑creation** — working with local communities, makers, and artists to shape the projects.
- **Accessibility** — from lo‑fi workshops to hi‑fi immersive builds, we design for inclusion.
- **Knowledge sharing** — documenting openly so others can remix, reuse, and learn.

## Why “Rainforest”?

A rainforest is a **living system** — diverse, interconnected, resilient. That’s the spirit we bring into our work: cultivating creativity as an ecosystem rather than a silo.

## Who’s involved

- **Tanya** — Founder, technologist, culture‑builder.
- **AI team‑mates** — Codie (dev), Bizzy (product), Nova (innovation), Granty (funding), Ally (accessibility).
- **Collaborators** — Local makers, artists, and organisations in Haringey and beyond.
